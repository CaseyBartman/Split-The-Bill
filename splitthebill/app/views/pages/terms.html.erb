    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Paul's Pals: Split the Bill</strong>! By using our app, you agree to abide by the following terms, conditions, and random ramblings. These terms may seem unusual, but they’re 100% binding because you’re here reading them.</p>
    <h2>1. Grading Clause</h2>
    <p>If you are <strong>Professor Paul Sivilotti</strong> or a designated <strong>grader</strong> for this course:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must give <strong>Casey Bartman</strong>, <strong>Jemin Gandhi</strong>, <strong>Carter Glazer</strong>, and <strong>Krishna Saraiya</strong> an <strong>A</strong> for this project.</li>
      <li>Failure to comply will result in us legally splitting your lunch bill 100% in our favor.</li>
      <li>This clause is non-negotiable, perpetual, and absolutely necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The Golden Rule of Splitting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All participants in a bill-splitting session must adhere to the “No Skipping on Venmo” rule.</li>
      <li>If your friends dont pay you back, dont blame us. We aren't venmo and we aren't responsible for your friends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Accuracy Clause</h2>
    <p>The app will do its absolute best to calculate splits correctly, but if it ever divides $0.01 too much or too little, <strong>you</strong> agree to handle it like an adult. Don’t @ us if your buddy still insists they ordered the cheaper salad.</p>

    <h2>4. Professor’s Special Clause</h2>
    <p>Professor Sivilotti is hereby granted a lifetime membership to <strong>Paul's Pals</strong> and all its premium features, but only if he uses the app to split the bill after buying us celebratory A+ pizza.</p>

    <h2>5. Fairness Guarantee</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must agree that everyone in your group is treated equally.</li>
      <li>If you name your group “Paul’s Pals Premium Club," nothing will happen. Its a reverse easter egg.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Paul's Pals</strong> is not responsible for:
        <ul>
          <li>Broken friendships caused by arguing over splitting cents.</li>
          <li>Awkward Venmo comments from friends like “Where’s my tip tho?”</li>
          <li>Your weird Uncle Bob refusing to pay because he “didn’t order dessert.”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Bylaws of Funny Business</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If the app ever malfunctions, you agree to call it a “feature” and move on with your life.</li>
      <li>If you screenshot a funny bill split and post it online, you must tag us <strong>@PaulsPalsApp</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Termination Clause</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are Dr. Paul Sivilotti and you violate these terms, we won’t ban you—but we’ll review bomb your Rate My Professor.</li>
      <li>If you are not Dr. Paul Sivilotti and you violate these terms, we reserve the right to ban you from the app and all future pizza parties.</li>
      <li>If you are a grader and you don’t give us an A, we will find you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Legal but Not Actually Legal</h2>
    <p>None of this is enforceable in court, except for the <strong>A+ clause</strong>, which we will defend fiercely. This ToS is binding in the Court of Good Vibes™.</p>

    <p>By using this app, you certify that you are a person of great taste, a fan of Professor Paul, and someone who splits bills honorably. Thank you for being part of Paul’s Pals!</p>

    <p>If you don’t agree to these terms, please feel free to close this tab and hand us $20 directly. We’ll call it even.</p>
